Project Title: Dead Lock Avoidance using Bankers Algorithm

The motivation to code this algorithm is because this assignment is a requirement for the course 

to install and run our code download an IDE such as Visual Studio Code and the needed extensions to run c files

Kashif implemented the request resources function, release resources function  and added code to the main for testing purposes and also run

Hamdan implemented the  the asterik function,safery algorithm  and readfile. Also created a makefile 


To run the code in steps:
1. Make
2. ./assignment_4 10 5 7 8
3.  entering the command for example RQ 5 4 3 3 2 or RL 4 3 2 2 2 or * 2 3 3 3 3

there is a problem with the * i need to include the numbers for it otherwise it wouldnt work.
